# kb-burger
A full stack burger-logger web app featuring the use of Node, Express server, Handlebars for view generation and a homemade ORM. Node and MySQL are used to query and route data flow in the app.

The app itself is fairly straightforward but the focus here was to practice data flow, routing, view generation, etc., in a full stack design.

# How to use the Application
In the text area type in the name of a burger that you would like to eat, and hit the 'Add Burger' button.

Burgers in the MySQL database will appear in the list named 'Burgers to Eat'

# Technologies Used
